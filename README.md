# Real-Time-FER-HPE-Behavioral-Analysis-System
🔍 Overview
A real-time computer vision system that detects 7-class facial emotions using a custom PyTorch CNN (78% accuracy) and estimates 3D head orientation via MediaPipe. The outputs are combined into a valence–arousal interpretation module to infer behavioral states like Confidence, Nervousness, and Disengagement using live webcam input.

🚀 Key Features
1. Real-time webcam-based emotion recognition using deep learning
2. Robust head pose estimation using MediaPipe face landmarks
3. Behavioral inference from emotion + head pose fusion
4. Clean modular pipeline with optimized preprocessing
5. Scalable architecture for future hardware (e.g., FPGA deployment)

🧠 Tech Stack

1. PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV
2. MediaPipe, Matplotlib
3. Python (Real-time inference pipeline)
